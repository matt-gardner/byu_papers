I was sitting in a meeting, talking into a microphone in Spanish, interpreting so that the non-English speakers wearing headphones could understand what was going on.  I had interpreted like this many times in the last year, but this time got me thinking.  What if you could get a computer do this, and do it well?  I knew then that I had to change my major.
My major had been physics.  My father got a PhD in physics from Stanford.  His father got a PhD in physics from Harvard, and his dissertation, measuring the spin of the electron, won a Nobel Prize.  His professor received the prize, of course, but my grandfather was a physics professor for many years.  His father was the founder of modern soil physics.  My mother's father was on the Manhattan project.  Suffice it to say, I grew up incredibly interested in physics, determined to get a PhD and go on to win a Nobel Prize some day.  
Reality struck me around the time I started college, and I realized how very unlikely it was that I would actually get a Nobel Prize.  I still wanted to pursue my education in physics, and hopefully make some significant contribution to the field, but my delusions of grandeur had subsided slightly.
As I went about my goal of a degree in physics, a few classes I took kindled my interest in another field: computer science.  I enjoyed learning how to program a computer, but the field didn't supplant my intention to study physics until I realized that the problems I could solve with computer science were a lot more interesting to me than physics.
With a newfound fascination for computers, I started looking into artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing, and I began work in the Applied Machine Learning lab at BYU as a research assistant.  My educational experience and my preparation for graduate school since then has largely been shaped by my research.
