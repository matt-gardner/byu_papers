Matthew was born in Mountain View, California and grew up very interested in
physics.  His interests moved to computer science, however, while spending time
as a Spanish-English interpreter.  He became fascinated with the problem of
machine interpretation and other areas of natural language processing.  While
at Brigham Young University he started working in the Applied Machine Learning
lab and published several papers in academic conferences, including the
Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC) and Parallel Problem Solving from
Nature (PPSN).  During his undergraduate career he also spent a summer as an
intern at Google, Inc., where he developed a system that used machine learning
techniques to attribute phone calls advertisers received to specific ads played
on TV.  Matthew graduated from BYU summa cum laude and with university honors.
For his doctoral work he plans to pursue the problem that originally interested
him in computer science, machine interpretation.  His dream is to build a
system that can accurately interpret emotion in speech between languages.

Outside of the lab, Matthew enjoys spending time with his family.  He has a
one-year-old daughter that he loves to make laugh and another child on the way.
He and his wife enjoy playing flute and harp duets together.  He also enjoys
learning languages, so far learning English, Spanish, Slovene and ancient
Greek.
