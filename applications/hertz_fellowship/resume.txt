A concise resume, in chronological order, recapitulating significant periods of
technical and other creative activity since high school.

2004-2005 school year
4 semesters of physics (waves, optics, electricity and magnetism, experimental
and computational methods)
3 semesters of math (linear algebra, multi-variate calculus, differential
equations)
2 semesters of computer science

2005-2007
Away from school as a missionary for two years.  While I did not do any
technical work during this time, the experience was incredibly formative for me
in terms of character development and leadership skills.

2007-2008 school year
3 semesters of physics (quantum mechanics, electronics, partial differential
equations)
1 semester of statistics
4 semesters of computer science
Started working in a computer science research lab, focusing on particle swarm
optimization

Summer 2008
4 semesters of computer science
Continued work at CS research lab

2008-2009 school year
8 semesters of computer science
Co-authored a research paper accepted at the Congress on Evolutionary
Computation, a major conference in the field
Began research for honors thesis, for which I received a grant from BYU's
Office of Research and Creative Activities (ORCA)

Summer 2009
Internship at Google Inc., focusing on an application of machine learning

2009-2010 school year
Finished and defended my honors thesis
Honors thesis was accepted at Parallel Problem Solving in Nature, a major
conference
2 semesters of computer science
1 semester of mathematics (abstract algebra)
Awarded a BS in Computer Science from Brigham Young University (April 2010)
Received another ORCA grant to continue the work that started as my honors
thesis
Submitted a greatly expanded version of my honors thesis to Swarm Intelligence,
a top journal in the field

------------------

Summer 2010
1 semester of advanced statistics for machine learning
Attended the conference of the North American chapter of the Association for
Computational Linguistics
Received a scholarship to attend a two-week summer school at Johns Hopkins
University on human language technologies

Fall 2010
2 semesters of computer science
Submitted a paper to a workshop at Neural Information Processing Systems, a
respected conference in machine learning
