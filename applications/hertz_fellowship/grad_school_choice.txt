What are the considerations involved in your choice of graduate school?

For a long time my school of choice was the Massachussetts Institute of
Technology, mainly because that I always thought that it was the best, and I
wanted to go to the best school.  As I have more seriously looked into graduate
institutions, however, and seen the research presented at conferences from
various universities, I have realized that in my field of interest other
schools have better programs.  Both the University of California at Berkeley
and Carnegie-Mellon University are considered the top schools in natural
language processing, and I would have a hard time choosing between them.  My
preference would likely fall with UC Berkeley, however.  I attended a
conference for the North American chapter of the Association for Computational
Linguistics, and all of the papers at that conference that impressed me the
most were written by students at UC Berkeley.  It seems to me that they have
the best research in natural language processing in the world, likely because
they have a large group of very talented people in related areas, and there is
a lot of sharing of ideas.  I find that kind of environment very conducive to
learning and to research, and that is where I want to study.
