Summary of goals: (3000 characters)

As part of this statement, we are interested in your ideas about:

the kinds of research in which you would like to be engaged during your
graduate study or in the longer term; or

specific research questions that interest you and how you became interested in
them.


Please discuss these research interests in sufficient detail for an expert who
is technically competent in your field to judge your understanding of the
questions to be addressed. This includes relevant hypotheses and approaches one
might take to answering the questions, and other research principles required
to investigate the research area you identify. 

We are interested in not only the science, but also your longer-term goals and
how the science fits into your life as an individual. We do not want this to
look like a grant submission.
