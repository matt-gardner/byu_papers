The Publications, Awards, and Research experiences sections would be tedious to
copy here, and they are pretty straightforward from other materials I have in
this repository (my list_of_applications and list_of_awards, for example).
There are four shorter parts that I will list (each had to be under 400
characters, with a short description and contact info for someone who could
verify).
