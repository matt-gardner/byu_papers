MJ p. 61-62: There is some question as to what it even means to reconstruct the
"original" text of a document.  Do you reconstruct the parts that probably were
not there originally, but show up in all of our manuscripts?  Do you
reconstruct the sources of the document?  Or just the earliest manuscript?
