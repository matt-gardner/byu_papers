"original" text of a document.  Do you reconstruct the parts that probably were
not there originally, but show up in all of our manuscripts?  Do you
reconstruct the sources of the document?  Or just the earliest manuscript?

MJ p. 84: Textual criticism has been practiced for thousands of years
(wikipedia), but the first major work of Greek New Testament textual criticism
was published in 1707 by John Mill.
