MJ pp. 61-62: There is some question as to what it even means to reconstruct the
"original" text of a document.  Do you reconstruct the parts that probably were
not there originally, but show up in all of our manuscripts?  Do you
reconstruct the sources of the document?  Or just the earliest manuscript?

MJ p. 84: Textual criticism has been practiced for thousands of years
(wikipedia), but the first major work of Greek New Testament textual criticism
was published in 1707 by John Mill.

Types of variants (see MJ pp. 90-98):
- spelling errors
- periblepsis
- misunderstanding of abbreviations
- substitution of homophones
- changes in word order
- "fixing" factual errors
- "fixing" doctrinal/interpretive errors
- "harmonizing" the gospels

MJ p. 111: "The more difficult reading is preferable to the easier one."

MJ pp. 111-112: family trees of documents

A book to read: Westcott and Hort, "The New Testament in the Original Greek,"
1881.  (summarized in Metzger and Ehrman, so it might suffice just to read
that)

Evidence used to do textual criticism (see MJ pp. 128-132):
External evidence:
- Which manuscripts attest the reading?
- Are those manuscripts reliable?
- Why are they reliable?
- Age of manuscript
- Location of manuscript
- Readings disambiguated in other ways show reliability
Internal evidence:
- Intrinsic probabilities - what the author was likely to have written (style,
vocabulary, theology)
- Transcriptional probabilities - the probability that a scribe changed from
one reading to the other reading
