Conflict between real life and chess.

Bruce, chess teacher, tells dad about crazies who devote their life to chess.

Before state finals, he says, "Maybe it's better to not be number 1, then it
doesn't matter when you lose."

State finals, dad berates him when he threw the match.

They try to push the kid too hard, it ruins his childhood.  He wants to have
fun, they make it into too much.

Bruce says to Josh, "Contempt is a part of winning, you have to hate them.
They hate you."  Bobby Fischer held the world in contempt.  "I'm not him."

Josh wanted the certificate, Bruce got frustrated, mom kicks him out.  Dad
sides with Bruce, mom threatens divorce.

Dad gives in, but Josh now says that he has to win - probably to prove
something to his dad.

Goes back to the park, enjoys playing again.  Bruce doesn't want him to go to
nationals.  Dad learns his lesson, takes Josh fishing before nationals, not
allowed to think of chess.  Josh likes playing, so he wins.

Bruce gives in, gives Josh a real certificate, Josh is happy, gains some
confidence for his match.

In the end, chess is an art, just like Bruce said, he just got his art from
Washington Square.  He got training from Bruce, but kept his art.  Offers the
kid a draw, the kid won't take it.

Talks with kid at the end, whose dad cares too much.  Comforts the kid.
