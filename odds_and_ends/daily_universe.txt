You're right, my child is not a dog

I believe that it was my wife and child that you saw.  I can assure you that my
daughter had not been kidnapped, nor were any of the other horrifying
circumstances you imagined true.  Perhaps I can help you see how foolish it is
to judge someone when you have absolutely no idea of their circumstances.

Have you ever been pregnant and thrown up every day for three months?  Have you
considered how useless a pair of running shoes is to someone who rarely feels
well enough to go on a walk?  What about being pregnant while having a
one-year-old child?  Have you ever watched your child run into the road with
you unable to stop her?  Did you consider that a one-year-old's speed and
stamina could very well exceed that of her pregnant mother?  Have you ever
tried walking for a considerable distance while stooped down holding the hand
of a one-year-old child?  Have you considered the futility of even trying to
hold a one-year-old's hand for any significant length of time?

I don't know how your mother cared for four small children, but I imagine you
don't either.  Maybe you will have the stamina to chase your baby who is
running into the road while you are morning sick.  Or maybe you will find some
other way to keep your children safe.  But please don't be so quick to judge
people that you don't know.  Maybe, just maybe, there is some reasonable
explanation for their actions.
