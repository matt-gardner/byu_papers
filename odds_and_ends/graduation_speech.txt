"One heart broken by a careless word; a hundred voices cry, so rarely heard; a
thousand eyes that live inside the dark, waiting for a spark of light.  One
heart reaching for the least of them moves a hundred more to understand.  Soon
a thousand people called to serve change the world in time."

"I am just one voice, but one voice can still be heard...  I am just one voice,
but one voice can carry far, rising through the noise of a world so damp and
dark."

We, all of us, have the potential to do great good in the world.  Though we may
feel small and insignificant, yet we can be great.  If we have such great
potential, and all of us do, why do we so often fail to live up to it? 

I believe that everyone, somewhere deep down, has the desire to be more than
they are, to live better, to be something great.  Perhaps you might call that a
heaven-sent "pull upward," God pulling us back to Him.  But again, if the
desire is there, why do people not follow it?

I've thought a lot about that question, and I have come to the conclusion that
people need someone to follow.  Rarely will a person spontaneously do something
great; almost always great demonstrations of valor, courage, and even kindness,
are caused by seeing the same actions done by someone else.

For example, I was on a trip in Mexico just after my mission, with my aunt and
four of my siblings.  We were driving down the freeway, and an enormous
rainstorm came out of nowhere, as can only happen in the tropics.  My aunt was
driving and didn't feel comfortable driving through that much rain, so she
pulled over to the side of the road.  Less than a minute after we pulled over,
a large roadsign, one of the ones that goes really high and tells what exits
are coming up, was knocked over by the wind not 100 feet in front of us.  Part
of the sign was sticking out into the middle of the road.  We watched as
several cars went speeding by in the rain, a few barely seeing the fallen sign
in time to swerve out of the way.  "Someone is going to die," my aunt said.
"Someone is going to hit that sign and die."  So we decided to do something
about it.  My brother and I got out of the car, ran through the rain over to
the sign, and started pulling it out of the road.  It was really heavy, and we
were having a hard time.  But what amazed me was that two other cars, when
seeing what we were doing, stopped and got out to help us move the sign.

When we had gotten the sign as far out of the road as we could, we got back in
our car.  The rain had mostly stopped, so we kept on driving.  I didn't think
much of that little experience until I started reading in my book, "1776" by
David McCullough, as we were driving away.  It just so happened that I was
reading about December of 1776, when Washington's army was deserting him
because their contracts were up, and he couldn't pay them.  To try to save
Washington's army and the cause of America, Thomas Paine wrote a little
pamphlet called "The American Crisis."  In it he wrote, "These are the times
that try men's souls: The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this
crisis, shrink from the service of his country; but he that stands by it now,
deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.  ...  What we obtain to cheap,
we esteem too lightly: it is dearness only that gives every thing its value."

It was the words of one man, Thomas Paine, that kept Washington's army
together.  As I read that story, I thought about what had just happened on the
freeway.  We saw a lot of cars go by that post, barely dodging it, but no one
stopped to move it.  Then we braved the raging storm and got out to move the
sign.  Other people saw our example, and a few stopped to help.  I really doubt
that the people that stopped would have done so had we not been there setting
the example.

People want to help.  People want something to live for, a good cause to devote
themselves to.  They want to be great.  But most of the time when the
opportunity comes we are too afraid or too busy or too lazy to do something
about it.  What it takes is a person, or people, who are willing to act when no
one else is acting, and to stand up for what is right in the face of those who
don't really care.  Then their example awakens the innate goodness in those
around them, and lives are changed.  How much good there is that we can do!

My plea to you this morning is that as you leave this university you be men and
women like Thomas Paine, people who lift and inspire those around you.  It
doesn't take incredible physical strength or mental ability; sometimes just a
few words or a simple example will do.  As graduates of Brigham Young
University we have the responsibility to be great, to help the world be a
better place.  We who have been given so much must in turn give.  And you can.
All of us can choose, right now, to be better than we were yesterday, to more
fully live up to the people we know we should be.  And in so doing, we can
change the world in time.
