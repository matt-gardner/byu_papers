\begin{abstract}

Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has previously been parallelized only by 
adding more particles to the swarm or by parallelizing the evaluation of the
objective function.  However, some functions are better optimized with more
iterations and fewer particles.  Accordingly, we take inspiration from 
speculative execution commonly performed in modern processors and propose what
we call speculative evaluation in PSO.  Future positions of the particles are
speculated and evaluated in parallel with current positions, performing two
iterations of PSO at once.

We also propose another way of making use of these speculative particles,
keeping the best position found instead of the position that PSO actually would
have taken.  We show that for a number of functions, speculative evaluation
gives dramatic improvements over adding additional particles to the swarm.

\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been found to be a highly robust and
effective algorithm for solving many types of optimization problems.  For much
of the algorithm's history, PSO was run serially on a single machine.  However,
the world's computing power is increasingly coming from large clusters of
processors.  In order to efficiently utilize these resources for
computationally intensive problems, PSO needs to run in parallel.

Within the last few years, researchers have begun to recognize the need to
develop parallel implementations of PSO, publishing many papers on the subject.
The methods they have used include various synchronous algorithms
\cite{chu-2006-intelligent-parallel-pso, jin-2005-pso-antenna-designs,
parsopoulos-2004-parallel-vector-evaluated-pso,
schutte-2004-parallel-global-optimization-with-pso} and asynchronous algorithms
\cite{mostaghim-2006-multi-objective-pso-on-grids,
venter-2005-parallel-pso-asynchronous-evaluations}.  Parallelizing the
evaluation of the objective function can also be done in some cases, though
that is not an adaption of the PSO algorithm itself and thus is not the focus
of this paper.

These previous parallel techniques distribute the computation needed by the
particles in the swarm over the available processors.  If more processors are
available, these techniques increase the number of particles in the swarm,
either by adding individual particles or by adding entire new sub-swarms, but
in all cases the number of processors never exceeds the number of particles.
The number of iterations of PSO that the algorithms can perform is thus
inherently limited by the time it takes to evaluate the objective
function---additional processors add more particles, but do not make the
iterations go any faster.

For many functions there comes a point of diminishing returns with respect to
adding particles.  In \fig{evals-sphere} we show the value obtained after
50,000 function evaluations (not iterations) as a function of swarm size for
the well-know benchmark function Sphere (20 dimensions, reporting the average
of twenty runs).  Increasing the swarm size from 5 to 10 has a significant
effect on the value obtained.  However, increasing the swarm size from 16 to 30
makes the algorithm less efficient, that is, it reduces the progress the
algorithm makes per evaluation.  Other functions show similar trends, though
often the optimal swarm size is slightly larger.  For this reason, previous
work has recommended the use of a swarm size of 50 for
PSO~\cite{bratton-2007-defining-a-standard-for-pso}.  Thus, in at least some
cases, adding particles indefinitely will not yield an efficient
implementation. 

\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics[width=.8\columnwidth]{evals_sphere}
  \caption{Function Sphere with various swarm sizes. Error bars show median and
  10th and 90th percentiles.}
  \label{fig:evals-sphere}
\end{figure}

In this paper we consider PSO parallelization strategies for clusters of
thousands of processors and functions for which a single evaluation will take
at least tens of seconds, but probably minutes or perhaps hours.  Our purpose
is to explore the question of what to do with a thousand processors when 50 or
100 particles is the recommended swarm size, and simply increasing the swarm
size encounters diminishing returns.

To solve this problem, we propose a method for performing two iterations of PSO
at the same time in parallel that we call speculative evaluation.  The name
comes from an analogy to speculative execution (also known as branch
prediction) techniques commonly used in processors.  Modern processors, when
faced with a branch on which they must wait (e.g. a memory cache miss), guess
which way the branch will go and start executing, ensuring that any changes
can be undone.  If the processor guesses right, execution is
much farther ahead than if it had idly waited on the memory reference.  If
it guesses wrong, execution restarts where it would have been anyway.  

In this paper we show that the results of standard PSO can be reproduced
\emph{exactly}, two iterations at a time, using a speculative approach adapted
from speculative execution. We prove that the standard PSO equation can be
factored such that a set of speculative positions can be found which will
\emph{always} include the position computed in the next iteration.  By
computing the value of the objective function for each of the speculative
positions at the same time the algorithm evaluates the objective function for
the current position, it is possible to know the objective function values for
both the current and the next iteration at the same time.  We demonstrate this
principle by implementation and show that it produces exactly the same results
as standard PSO, but two iterations at a time.  The resulting implementation
runs efficiently on large clusters where the number of processors is much
larger than a typical or reasonable number of particles, producing better
results in less ``wall-clock'' time.

The balance of this paper is organized as follows. \sec{pso} describes the
particle swarm optimization algorithm.  \sec{sepso} describes how speculative
evaluation can be done in parallel PSO to perform two iterations at once, then
presents a comparison of the speculative algorithm with the original PSO.  In
\sec{conclusion} and \sec{future} we conclude and discuss future work.

\section{Particle Swarm Optimization}
\label{sec:pso}

Particle swarm optimization was proposed in 1995 by James Kennedy and Russell
Eberhart~\cite{kennedy-1995-particle-swarm-optimization}.  The algorithm is
used to intelligently search a multi-dimensional space by mimicking the
swarming and flocking behavior of birds and other animals. It is a social
algorithm that depends on interaction between particles to quickly and
consistently approximate the optimal solution to a given objective function.

The motion of particles through the search space has three components: an
inertial component that gives particles momentum as they move, a cognitive
component where particles remember the best solution they have found and are
attracted back to that place, and a social component by which particles are
attracted to the best solution that any of their neighbors have found.

At each iteration of the algorithm, the position $\ppos_t$ and velocity
$\pvel_t$ of each particle are updated as follows:
\begin{align}
\nonumber
	\pvel_{t+1} &=
		\constriction \bigl[ \pvel_t
			+ \pcoeff\pURand_{t}\otimes(\pbest_{t} - \ppos_{t}) \\
\label{eq:velupdate}
			& \quad \quad \quad \, + \ncoeff\nURand_{t}\otimes(\nbest_{t} - \ppos_{t})
		\bigr] \\
\label{eq:posupdate}
	\ppos_{t+1} &= \ppos_{t} + \pvel_{t+1}
\end{align}
where \( \pURand_{t} \) and \( \nURand_{t} \) are vectors of independent random
numbers drawn from a standard uniform distribution, the \( \otimes \) operator
is an element-wise vector multiplication, $\pbest$ (called personal best) is
the best position the current particle has seen, and $\nbest$ (called
neighborhood best) is the best position the neighbors of the current particle
have seen~\cite{bratton-2007-defining-a-standard-for-pso}.  The parameters \(
\ncoeff \), \( \pcoeff \), and \( \constriction \) are given prescribed values
required to ensure convergence (2.05, 2.05, and .73,
respectively)~\cite{clerc-2002-constricted-pso}. 

Changing the way neighbors are defined (often called the ``topology'' in the
literature) has a significant effect on the performance of the algorithm.  In
the Ring topology, each particle has one neighbor to either side of it; in the
Complete topology, every particle is a neighbor to every other
particle~\cite{bratton-2007-defining-a-standard-for-pso}.  In all topologies a
particle is also a neighbor to itself in that its own position and value are
considered when updating the particle's neighborhood best, $\nbest$.  Thus with
$p$ particles, using the Ring topology each particle with index $i$ has three
neighbors: $i-1$, $i$ (itself), and $i+1$.  With the Complete topology, each
particle has $p$ neighbors.

In this paper we use these topologies as well as a parallel adaptation of the
Complete topology, called Random, that has been shown to approximate the
behavior of Complete with far less
communication~\cite{mcnabb-2009-large-particle-swarms}.  In the Random
topology, each particle randomly picks two other particles to share information
with at each iteration, along with itself.  Thus in both the Ring and the
Random topologies, all particles have three neighbors.

\section{Speculative Evaluation in PSO}
\label{sec:sepso}

The PSO algorithm can be trivially parallelized by distributing the processing
needed for each particle on across processors.  But as we have seen in
\fig{evals-sphere}, for some functions, and for large numbers of
processors, just adding particles reaches a point of diminishing returns.
That is, adding processors does not help us reach any given level of fitness
appreciably faster.  Instead of adding particles we employ a speculative
evaluation approach that allows us to perform iterations two at a time.

To do so we must first refactor PSO such that the determination of the value
of the objective function is separate from the rest of the computation.  For
simplicity, this discussion will describe the case where PSO is performing
function minimization using the Ring topology.  In this example, each particle
has two neighbors, the ``right neighbor'' and ``left neighbor,'' whose
positions are represented as $\rightn$ and $\leftn$ respectively.  Though we
will only describe the case of the Ring topology, this method can easily be
extended to arbitrary topologies.

The refactoring hinges on the idea that once the random coefficients are
determined, there are only a few possibile updates to $\nbest$ and $\pbest$.
For the Ring topology there are 7 possible update cases, identified in
Table~\ref{tab:evals}.  We label each case with an identifier referring to the
source of the update: a minus sign ($-$) represents no update, $L$ represents
an update to $\nbest$ coming from the left neighbor, $R$ represents an update
to $\nbest$ coming from the right neighbor, and $S$ represents an update to
either $\pbest$ or $\nbest$ coming from the particle itself.  As an example,
$\casexn$ refers to the case that the particle finds a new personal best, but
neither it nor its neighbors found a position that updated its neighborhood
best.  In the equations that follow, we refer to an unspecified update case as
$\casegen$, and to the set of cases collectively as $\caseset$.

\begin{table}
  \caption{All possible updates for a particle with two neighbors}
  \label{tab:evals}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lcc}
	Identifier&Source of $\pbest$ update&Source of $\nbest$ update\\
	\hline
	\hline
	$\casepn$&No update&No update\\
	\hline
	$\casepl$&No update&Left Neighbor\\
	\hline
	$\casepr$&No update&Right Neighbor\\
	\hline
	$\casexn$&Self&No update\\
	\hline
	$\casexl$&Self&Left Neighbor\\
	\hline
	$\casexr$&Self&Right Neighbor\\
	\hline
	$\casexx$&Self&Self\\
	\hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

In order to incorporate the determination of which case occurs into the
position and velocity update equations, we introduce an indicator function
$\indic_{t+1}^{\casegen}$ for each case $\casegen \in \caseset$.  When
$\casegen$ corresponds to the case actually taken by PSO,
$\indic_{t+1}^{\casegen}$ evaluates to 1; otherwise it evaluates to 0.  We can
then sum over all of the cases, and the indicator function will make all of the
terms drop to zero except for the case that actually occurs.  For example, the
indicator function for the specific case $\casexn$ can be written as follows:

\begin{align}
  \nonumber
	\indic_{t+1}^{\casexn} & (\ofunc ( \ppos_{t} ) ,\ofunc(\leftn_{t}),
	\ofunc(\rightn_{t}) ,\ofunc(\pbest_{t-1}) ,\ofunc(\nbest_{t-1}))= \\
  \label{eq:deficasexn}
	&\begin{cases}
	   1 & \text{if} \ \ofunc(\ppos_{t}) < \ofunc(\pbest_{t-1}) \\
	   &\quad \wedge \quad \ofunc(\nbest_{t-1}) < \ofunc(\ppos_{t}) \\
	   &\quad \wedge \quad \ofunc(\nbest_{t-1}) < \ofunc(\leftn_{t}) \\
	   &\quad \wedge \quad \ofunc(\nbest_{t-1}) < \ofunc(\rightn_{t}) \\
	   0 & \text{otherwise}
	\end{cases}
\end{align}

For each case $\casegen \in \caseset$, there is also a corresponding
velocity update function $\specvel_{t+1}^{\casegen}$.  When the case is
known, the specific values of $\pbest_t$ and $\nbest_t$ may be substituted
directly into~\eqref{eq:velupdate}.  For example, in case $\casexn$,
$\pbest_{t}=\ppos_{t}$, as \pbest was updated by the particle's current
position, and $\nbest_{t}=\nbest_{t-1}$, as $\nbest$ was not updated at
iteration $t$:
\begin{align}
\nonumber
	\specvel_{t+1}^{\casexn} & (\pvel_t, \ppos_{t}, \leftn_{t}, \rightn_{t},
	\pbest_{t-1}, \nbest_{t-1}, \pURand_{t}, \nURand_{t}) \\
\nonumber
		&= \constriction \bigl[ \pvel_{t} +
			\pcoeff\pURand_{t}\otimes(\ppos_{t} - \ppos_{t}) \\
\label{eq:defvcasexn}
			& \quad \quad \quad \; + \ncoeff\nURand_{t}\otimes(\nbest_{t-1} -
			\ppos_{t}) \bigr]
\end{align}

In the same way we can create notation for the position update function by
substituting into~\eqref{eq:posupdate}.  For compactness, we will drop the
parameters to $\specvel_{t+1}^{\casegen}$ since they can be inferred from the
subscripts.
\begin{align}
\label{eq:defpcasegen}
	\specpos_{t+1}^{\casegen} & (\ppos_{t}, \pvel_{t}, \leftn_{t},
	\rightn_{t} ,\pbest_{t-1} ,\nbest_{t-1}, \pURand_{t}, \nURand_{t}) \\
\nonumber
	& = \ppos_{t} + \specvel_{t+1}^{\casegen}
\end{align}

With this notation we can re-write the original PSO velocity
equation~\eqref{eq:velupdate}, introducing our sum over cases with the
indicator functions.  Again, we represent the indicator functions and velocity
functions without the parameters for compactness.  The equation becomes:
\begin{align}
\nonumber
	\pvel_{t+1} &=
		\constriction \bigl[ \pvel_t
			+ \pcoeff\pURand_{t}\otimes(\pbest_{t} - \ppos_{t}) \\
\nonumber
			& \quad \quad \quad \, + \ncoeff\nURand_{t}\otimes(\nbest_{t} -
			\ppos_{t}) \bigr] \\
\nonumber
	&= \sum_{c \in \caseset} \indic_{t+1}^{c} \ \constriction \bigl[ \pvel_t
			+ \pcoeff\pURand_{t}\otimes(\pbest_{t} - \ppos_{t}) \\
\nonumber
			& \quad \quad \quad \, + \ncoeff\nURand_{t}\otimes(\nbest_{t} -
			\ppos_{t}) \bigr]  \\
\label{eq:vel2update}
	&= \sum_{c \in \caseset} \ \indic_{t+1}^{c} \ \specvel_{t+1}^{c} 
\end{align}

Similarly, the position update equation~\eqref{eq:posupdate} becomes:
\begin{align}
\nonumber
	\ppos_{t+1} &= \ppos_{t} + \pvel_{t+1} \\
\label{eq:pos2update}
	&= \sum_{c \in \caseset} \ \indic_{t+1}^{c} \ \specpos_{t+1}^{c} 
\end{align}

The value of the objective function at $\ppos_{t+1}$ is given by:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:val2update}
	\ofunc (\ppos_{t+1}) = \sum_{c \in \caseset} \ \indic_{t+1}^{c}
	\ \ofunc(\specpos_{t+1}^{c})
\end{align}

Returning our attention to the computation of $\ppos_{t+1}$ in
\eqref{eq:pos2update} and writing it with the parameters which were omitted
above, we obtain:
\begin{align}
\nonumber
  \ppos_{t+1} &= \sum_{c \in \caseset} \\
\nonumber
	& \indic_{t+1}^{c}(\ofunc ( \ppos_{t} ) ,\ofunc(\leftn_{t}),
	\ofunc(\rightn_{t}) ,\ofunc(\pbest_{t-1}) ,\ofunc(\nbest_{t-1})) \\
\label{eq:val2updatelong}
	& \specpos_{t+1}^{c}(\ppos_{t},\pvel_{t},\leftn_{t},\rightn_{t},
	\pbest_{t-1},\nbest_{t-1},\pURand_{t}, \nURand_{t})
\end{align}

In this form the important point to notice is that there are only 7 values (for
this Ring topology) in the set $\{\specpos_{t+1}^{\casegen}: \casegen \in
\caseset\}$ and that none of them depend upon $f(\ppos_t)$ or any other
objective function evaluation at iteration $t$ (note also that while there are
random numbers in the equation, they are assumed fixed once drawn for any
particular particle at a specific iteration).  Thus PSO has been refactored
such that the algorithm can begin computing all 7 of the objective function
evaluations potentially needed in iteration $t+1$ \emph{before} $f(\ppos_t)$ is
computed.  Once the evaluation of $f(\ppos_{t})$ is completed for all particles
only one of the indicator functions $\indic_{t+1}^{\casegen}$ will be set to 1;
hence only one of the positions $\specpos_{t+1}^\casegen$ will be kept.

Although this speculative algorithm computes
$\ofunc(\specpos_{t+1}^{\casegen})$ for all $\casegen \in \caseset$, even those
for which $\indic_{t+1}^{\casegen} = 0$, these extra computations will be
ignored, and might just as well never have been computed.  We call the set of
computations $\{\ofunc(\specpos_{t+1}^{c}) : \casegen \in \caseset\}$
``speculative children'' because only one of them will be needed.

To see the value of this refactoring, suppose that 1000 processors are
available, and that the evaluation of the function to be optimized takes one
hour.  If we only want a swarm of 100 particles, 900 of the processors would be
sitting idle for an hour at every iteration, and it would take two hours to run
two iterations.  If instead we perform speculative evaluation, sending each of
the $\ofunc(\specpos_{t+1}^{c})$ to be computed at the same time as
$\ofunc(\ppos_{t})$, we would use 800 of the 1000 processors and perform two
iterations in one hour.

In order to do two iterations at once, we must use 8 times as many processors
as there are particles in the swarm.  If we were not performing speculative
evaluation, those processors might very well be used to add particles to the
swarm.  This then raises the question of whether a swarm of 100 particles doing
twice as many iterations outperforms a swarm of 800 particles.  We show in the
rest of this paper that in many, though not all, instances, a smaller swarm
performing more iterations does in fact outperform a larger swarm.

The number of speculative evaluations needed per particle depends on the number
of neighbors each particle has.  The number of update cases in a topology where
each particle has $n$ neighbors is $2(n+1)$; there are two possibilities for
updates to $\pbest$ (updated by the particle itself and not updated), and $n+1$
possibilities for updates to $\nbest$ (updated by each neighboring particle and
not updated).  When the particle is also a neighbor to itself, as is always the
case in commonly used topologies, one of the cases can be eliminated, as a
particle cannot be the source of an update to its neighborhood best while not
also updating its personal best.  Thus we have $2(n+1)-1$, or $2n+1$,
speculative evaluations per particle.  In a swarm with $p$ particles and $n$
neighbors per particle, $(2n+1)p$ speculative evaluations are needed.

Because the number of speculative evaluations depends on the number of
neighbors a particle has, the choice of topology is an important one.  The use
of the Complete topology, where every particle is a neighbor to every other
particle, would require $O(p^2)$ speculative evaluations per iteration.
Clearly it is much more desirable to have a sparse topology, where $O(np)$ is
much smaller than $O(p^2)$.  However, some functions are better optimized with
the Complete topology and the quick spread of information it entails than with
sparse topologies.  Accordingly, we use the Random topology described
in~\cite{mcnabb-2009-large-particle-swarms}, which has been shown to
effectively simulate the Complete topology.  In~\sec{results} we report the
results for performing speculative evaluation using both the Ring topology and
the Random topology on a number of common benchmark functions.

It is not trivial in some parallel architectures to determine which speculative
position was the correct next position of each particle.  In the rest of this
section we move from the mathematics of our method to its implementation.
First we discuss the relatively easy case of a centralized parallel PSO
algorithm with a master computer and many slaves.  In such an architecture, the
master keeps track of all necessary information with only trivial message
passing needed.  Then we discuss the more complicated case of a distributed
algorithm, where each particle is on its own and needs to send and receive
messages to and from other particles.  Finally we discuss the further
complications of a dynamic topology, where a particle's neighbors change from
one iteration to another.

\subsection{Terminology}

To aid in describing our methodology, we introduce a few terms.  A particle's
set of \emph{speculative children} is the set of all possible next iteration
states that a particle could have.  We use $\p_t$ to denote a particle at
iteration $t$ and $\s_{t+1}$ to denote one of $\p_t$'s speculative children,
corresponding to one of the rows in Table~\ref{tab:evals}.  $\n_t$ is a
neighbor of particle $\p_t$.  Sets of particles are given by $\pset$, $\sset$,
or $\nset$, whereas single particles are simply $\p$, $\s$, or $\n$.

We separate each iteration of PSO into several steps.  First there is the
motion step, where a particle updates its position and velocity.  Then a
particle's position is evaluated, and the particle updates its current value
and its personal best.  Finally, a particle gets information from its neighbors
and updates its neighborhood best.

A particle at iteration $t-1$ that has been moved to iteration $t$ using
\eqref{eq:velupdate}~and~\eqref{eq:posupdate}, but whose position has
not yet been evaluated, is denoted as $\noeval{\p}_t$.  Once its position has
been evaluated, but it has still not yet received information from its
neighbors, it is denoted as $\nonbest{\p}_t$.  Only when the particle has
updated its neighborhood best is it a complete particle at iteration $t$.  It
is then simply denoted as $\p_t$.

\subsection{Centralized Algorithms}

In a centralized, or Master-Slave, parallel PSO algorithm, one machine, the
master, keeps track of all necessary information, and all other machines are
merely used to evaluate the objective function at various positions as directed
by the master~\cite{belal-2004-parallel-models-for-pso}.  To perform
speculative evaluation in such an architecture, the master generates the
positions to evaluate speculatively as in \eqref{eq:defpcasegen}.  After having
the slaves evaluate the objective function at all necessary positions, the
master then decides which position to accept for each particle, as in
\eqref{eq:val2updatelong}.  The outline of the procedure is given in
\alg{centralized}.

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{Speculative Evaluation in a Centralized PSO}
  \label{alg:centralized}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
	\STATE Move all $\p_{t-1}$ to $\noeval{\p}_t$ using
	  \eqref{eq:velupdate}~and~\eqref{eq:posupdate}
	\STATE For each $\noeval{\p}_t$, get its neighbors $\noeval{\nset}_t$ and
	  generate $\noeval{\sset}_{t+1}$ according to
	  \eqref{eq:defpcasegen}.
	\STATE Evaluate all $\noeval{\p}_t$ and $\noeval{\sset}_{t+1}$ in parallel
	\STATE Update personal best for each $\noeval{\p}_t$ and
	  $\noeval{\s}_{t+1}$, creating $\nonbest{\p}_t$ and $\nonbest{\s}_{t+1}$
	\STATE Update neighborhood best for each $\nonbest{\p}_t$, creating
	  $\pset_t$
	\FORALL{$\p_t$}
	\STATE Pick $\nonbest{\s}_{t+1}$ from $\nonbest{\sset}_{t+1}$ that matches
	  the branch taken by $\p_t$ according to
	  \eqref{eq:val2updatelong}.
	\STATE Pass along personal and neighborhood best values obtained by $\p_t$,
	  making $\nonbest{\p}_{t+1}$
	\ENDFOR
	\STATE Update neighborhood best for each $\nonbest{\p}_{t+1}$, creating
	  $\pset_{t+1}$
	\STATE Repeat from Step 1 until finished
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Given a set of particles at iteration $t-1$ (perhaps which have just been
initialized), the master must move each particle using \eqref{eq:velupdate} and
\eqref{eq:posupdate} to obtain the set $\noeval{\pset}_t$.  For each particle
$\noeval{\p}_t$, the master must then get its set of neighbors
$\noeval{\nset}_t$ and use their positions, along with the position of
$\noeval{\p}_t$, to calculate all possible values of
$\specpos_{t+1}^{\casegen}$, using \eqref{eq:defpcasegen}.  These positions,
along with the original particle's associated information (such as values for
$\pbest$ and $\nbest$), define a set of speculative children,
$\noeval{\sset}_{t+1}$.  The master than has a set of particles
$\noeval{\pset}_t$, and for each particle a set of speculative children
$\noeval{\sset}_{t+1}$, which can all be evaluated at once.

The master then has the slaves evaluate the particles.  Once all particles,
speculative and original, have been evaluated and the values reported to the
master, the master determines which speculative child of each particle was the
correct one.  Mathematically, this corresponds to the evaluation of an
indicator function similar to that found in \eqref{eq:deficasexn}.  In
practice, this is done first by updating each particle's $\pbest$, if
necessary, then by updating the particle's $\nbest$ with information from the
particle's neighbors.  This is simply the original PSO algorithm, and
corresponds to steps 1--5 in \alg{centralized}.  Given the updates to $\pbest$
and $\nbest$, the case from Table~\ref{tab:evals} can be determined, as per
\eqref{eq:val2updatelong}.  The child with the matching case is kept, and all
other speculative children are discarded (step 7 in \alg{centralized}.

The parent $\p_t$ must pass its personal best value to the child, as the child
knows only the position that it guessed, not the function value at that
position.  It is possible that both $\p_t$ and $\s_{t+1}$ update their personal
bests, but $\p_t$'s value is better.  For example, suppose that $\p_{t-1}$ has
a personal best value of 3, and the we are seeking to minimize the function.
$\noeval{\p}_t$ is created, and $\noeval{\s}_{t+1}$ is moved assuming that
$\p_t$ has updated its personal best with its position at time $t$.  Then both
$\noeval{\p}_t$ and $\noeval{\s}_{t+1}$ are evaluated, with values 1 and 2,
respectively.  $\nonbest{\s}_{t+1}$ would think that its current position is
its personal best, as the value it found, 2, is better than its previous
personal best value of 3.  It needs to receive the personal best value from its
parent to know that its personal best position $\pbest$ is actually the
position of $\p_t$, not $\s_{t+1}$.

The parent also needs to pass the value of the neighborhood best that the child
guessed.  The child only knows the position and needs the value in order to
make future comparisons between neighborhood best positions (step 8).

Upon picking the correct branch for each particle and updating the child's
personal best and neighborhood best value (from iteration $t$), the result is
the set $\nonbest{\pset}_{t+1}$, as the particles are now no longer
speculative.  What remains is to update the neighborhood best of those
particles from their neighbors (from iteration $t+1$), as above, to obtain
$\pset_{t+1}$.  That set of particles can subsequently be used to produce the
sets $\noeval{\pset}_{t+2}$ and $\noeval{\sset}_{t+3}$ (steps 1 and 2 in
\alg{centralized}), and the process repeats itself.

\subsection{Distributed Algorithms}

\label{sec:distributed}

In a distributed parallel PSO algorithm, individual processors not only perform
evaluations of particles, but also their movement.  The information for each
particle is not held by a central machine that directs the algorithm; instead,
each processor has the information for the particle or particles that it is in
charge of and must perform the steps of the algorithm for those
particles~\cite{mcnabb-2007-parallel-pso-using-mapreduce}.  Messages such as
values and positions for the neighborhood best are sent between processors.
There may still be some machine that collects information from all of the
particles and outputs the result of the algorithm, though that machine's
importance is much less than in centralized algorithms.

To perform speculative evaluation in a distributed PSO algorithm, there must be
some way to have processors evaluate the speculative children of particles,
without giving the speculative particles the same treatment as actual
particles, as the speculative children only live for one iteration.  One way
that can be done is by assigning each particle a set of machines instead of a
single machine, and the particle directs its extra machines to evaluate its
speculative children.  However the distributed framework functions, the same
information needs to be passed between particles, and we describe here the
messages each particle needs to receive to perform speculative evaluation.

A processor that is controlling a single particle $\p_{t-1}$ must first move
the particle to $\noeval{\p}_t$ and produce the particle's speculative children
$\noeval{\sset}_{t+1}$.  This is done in the same way as described above.
However, in order to produce $\noeval{\sset}_{t+1}$, the processor needs
information about the particle's neighbors, so there must be some message
passing to get that information.  Particularly, the information that the
processor needs is the position of each of the particle's neighbors at
iteration $t$.

To get that information, a round of message passing is required.  Each particle
sends its position to its neighbors at iteration $t$, so that all particles can
generate $\noeval{\sset}_{t+1}$.  After each particle evaluates its position
and the positions of its speculative children, it passes information about the
outcome of iteration $t$ to its neighbors, so that neighboring particles can
update their neighborhood bests to move from $\nonbest{\p}_t$ to $\p_t$.  Once
that communication is finished, the particle can select the speculative child
which matched the branch that iteration $t$ actually produced.  Then another
round of information passing follows, for iteration $t+1$, so that
$\nonbest{\p}_{t+1}$ can be updated to $\p_{t+1}$.  Two iterations have then
been completed with only one round of evaluations, and the next iteration can
start again with the first round of message passing.

In some distributed frameworks, like the MapReduce framework that we used in
our experiments, rounds of message passing can be expensive.  The method just
described uses three rounds of message passing for every two iterations
(corresponding to steps 2, 5 and 10 in \alg{centralized}).  It is possible to
perform speculative evaluation in PSO with only one round of communication per
two iterations.  However, the methodology is tedious and is not the focus of
this paper, so we defer its description to the Appendix.

\subsection{Dynamic Topologies}

Performing speculative evaluation in PSO with a dynamic topology raises a
sticky issue of its own.  In a static topology, at iteration $t$ a particle
already has all of the information about the positions of its neighbors during
iterations $1$ through $t-1$.  If the neighbor finds a better position at
iteration $t$, the particle updates its neighborhood best, but if it does not,
it still has its old neighborhood best from its neighbors for all previous
iterations.

In a dynamic topology, a particle might not have information about the previous
positions of its neighbors at iteration $t$.  That means that its new
neighborhood best could come not only from its neighbors' positions at
iteration $t$, but also from their personal best from iteration $t-1$, as
neighbors' personal bests are what are used to update a particle's neighborhood
best.  That creates a problem for speculative evaluation---there are
potentially more than $2n+1$ possible next positions, increasing the amount of
work that must be done to perform the second iteration at the same time as the
first.

This is easily fixed by updating each new particle $\noeval{\p}_{t+2}$ with the
currently available information about its neighbors $\noeval{\nset}_{t+2}$
before producing its children $\noeval{\sset}_{t+3}$.  If a particle
$\noeval{\p}_{t+2}$ updates its neighborhood best with the personal bests of
$\noeval{\nset}_{t+2}$ before calculating the next possible positions for
$\noeval{\sset}_{t+3}$, there are still only $2n+1$ possible next positions,
and the problem is avoided.

\section{Using All Speculative Evaluations}
\label{sec:extra}

In performing speculative evaluation as we have described it, $2(n+1)-1$
speculative evaluations are done per particle, while all but one of them are
completely ignored.  It seems reasonable to try to make use of those
evaluations instead of throwing them away.  Making use of them changes the
behavior of PSO, instead of reproducing it exactly as the above method
explains, but the change could be an improvement.

To use the extra speculative evaluations, instead of choosing the speculative
child that matches that branch that the original PSO would have taken, we take
the child that has the best value.  The methodology is exactly the same as
above except for the process of choosing which speculative child to accept.
The branch that PSO would have taken is ignored, but $\p_t$ must still be
created so it can give the right personal best and neighborhood best values and
positions to $\p_{t+1}$.  The only change needed in \alg{centralized} is in
step 7, where the $\noeval{\s}_{t+1}$ with the best value is chosen from
$\noeval{\sset}_{t+1}$ instead of with the matching branch.

This can be thought of as drawing a number of samples from the next iteration
and accepting the best one.  Speculative particles that move in good directions
are kept.  It seems this modification to PSO would produce more exploitation,
decreasing the amount of exploration.  With functions that are less deceptive
we would expect this method to work well, while performance on more deceptive
functions would probably be hurt.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

In our experiments we compared our speculative PSO algorithm to the standard
PSO algorithm.  At each iteration of the algorithms, we use one processor to
perform one function evaluation for one particle, be it speculative or
non-speculative.  The speculative algorithm actually performs two iterations of
PSO at each ``iteration,'' so we instead call each ``iteration'' a round of
evaluations.  For benchmark functions with very fast evaluations this may not
be the best use of parallelism in PSO.  But for many real-world applications,
the objective function takes on the order of minutes or more to evaluate; in
such cases our assumption is perfectly reasonable.

To use the same number of processors for each algorithm, speculative evaluation
needs a smaller swarm size than standard PSO.  For each of the topologies we
used, a particle has two neighbors other than itself.  As shown in
Table~\ref{tab:evals}, this results in $7$ speculative evaluations per
particle.  With one evaluation needed for the original, non-speculative
particle, we have $8p_s$ evaluations for every two iterations, where $p_s$ is
the number of particles in the speculative swarm.  The extra evaluations done
in speculative evaluation would instead be particles in regular PSO, so we
compare swarms of size $p_s$ in speculative evaluation with swarms of size
$8p_s$ in regular PSO.

Where the Complete topology would normally be used, we use a Random topology in
our speculative algorithm, as Complete leads to an explosion of speculative
evaluations.  However, if speculative evaluation were not being performed, it
is likely that the Complete topology would be used, ignoring the communication
cost of Complete over Random.  To be fair in our comparisons, for the standard
PSO algorithm we compare to both the Random topology with two neighbors and to
the Complete topology.  All functions have 20 dimensions, and all results shown
are averages over 20 runs.  We use 240 processors in our experiments, so
speculative algorithms use 30 particles and standard PSO uses 240 particles.
For ease of labeling, we call our speculative algorithm SEPSO, the variant
SEPSO Pick Best, and standard PSO just PSO.

First we look at the function Sphere, the simplest of common benchmark
functions.  Its equation is $f(\Vec{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^D x_i^2$.  The function
has no local optima and is best optimized in terms of function evaluations with
a small swarm using a Complete topology.  Accordingly, we show results for a
small Complete swarm in \fig{sphere1}.  In comparing SEPSO with PSO, we can see
that SEPSO clearly beats PSO with a Random topology.  However, the performance
between SEPSO and PSO Complete is not as encouraging---PSO Complete performs
slightly better.  But SEPSO Pick Best handily outperforms all other algorithms
in this problem.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.8\columnwidth]{sphere1}
  \caption{Function Sphere with a swarm that uses 240 processors per round of
  evaluations.  Speculative algorithms have a swarm of 30 particles and do two
  iterations per round, while standard PSO algorithms use 240 processors and do
  one iteration per round.}
  \label{fig:sphere1}
\end{figure}

Next we look at the function Griewank, defined by the equation $f(\Vec{x}) =
\frac{1}{4000} \sum_{i=1}^D x_i^2 - \Pi_{i=1}^D \cos\left(\frac{x_i}{\sqrt{i}}
\right) + 1$.  It is generally recommended to use the Ring topology when
optimizing the Griewank function, as Complete is prone to premature convergence
on a local optimum.  Griewank has a global optimum with a value of 0, and
sometimes the swarm finds the optimum and sometimes it doesn't.  Instead of
showing average function value at each iteration, a more accurate plot for
Griewank shows the percent of runs that have found the global optimum by each
iteration.  We show results in \fig{griewank1} for swarms of size 30 and 240
using the Ring topology.  One can see in the figure that both SEPSO algorithms
find the optimum faster than the original PSO.  However, because the swarm size
is so small, SEPSO gets stuck a little less than half of the time.
Surpisingly, SEPSO Pick Best improves the chance of success with Griewank,
while also finding the optimum faster.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.8\columnwidth]{griewank1}
  \caption{Function Griewank with a swarm that uses 240 processors per round of
  evaluations, showing percent successful by each iteration instead of average
  function value.}
  \label{fig:griewank1}
\end{figure}

Because our speculative algorithm got stuck with such a small swarm size, we
ran a set of experiments on Griewank with 800 processors, giving swarms of size
100 and 800 instead of 30 and 240.  \fig{griewank2} shows the results.
\fig{griewank2} is very similar to \fig{griewank1}, except the speculative
algorithms find the global optimum essentially 100\% of the time.  Thus with a
few more processors, our algorithms find the optimum two to three times faster
than the original PSO without a significant loss of accuracy.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.8\columnwidth]{griewank2}
  \caption{Function Griewank with a swarm that uses 800 processors per round of
  evaluations.}
  \label{fig:griewank2}
\end{figure}

Lastly we look at a function that does not show much or any improvement with
this method.  The function Rastrigin is defined as $f(\Vec{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^D
\left(x_i^2 - 10\cos\left(2\pi x_i\right) + 10\right)$.  It has been shown that
with Rastrigin, the more particles there are in the swarm, the lower function
value it finds, up to at least 4000
particles~\cite{mcnabb-2009-large-particle-swarms}.  Smaller swarms get caught
in local optima.  Because our speculative algorithms have a significantly
smaller swarm size, they get stuck at higher values while the larger swarms
performing regular PSO continue to improve the best value found.
\fig{rastrigin} shows the results graphically.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.8\columnwidth]{rastrigin}
  \caption{Function Rastrigin with a swarm that uses 240 processors per round
  of evaluations.}

\end{figure}

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have described how parallel implementations of particle swarm optimization
can be modified to allow additional processors to increase the number of
iterations of the algorithm performed, instead of merely adding more particles
to the swarm.  We have detailed several different implementations of the
algorithm, depending on the parallel PSO framework being used.  Using our
modifications, the original PSO algorithm is exactly reproduced two iterations
at a time.  This technique requires more function evaluations per iteration
than regular PSO, but for some functions still performs better when run in a
parallel environment.

We have also described a method for making use of extra speculative evaluations
that performs incredibly well on some functions.

Though space has limited our presentation of results to a very small sample of
the interesting and relevant applications of our technique, we believe the
results shown are sufficient motivation for the further exploration of
speculative evaluation in PSO.

Our results show that performing speculative evaluation instead of increasing
swarm size is only beneficial for some functions at the swarm sizes we used.
However, we would venture that for all functions there is some point at which
increasing the swarm size provides relatively little benefit.  At that point,
additional processors should be used to speed up the algorithm instead of add
additional particles.

There are some functions for which very little exploration needs to be done;
Sphere is an example of such a function.  For such functions the best use of
processors is to have a small swarm performing speculative evaluation with our
second method, where all speculative evaluations are used.

There are other functions for which there is a point where the algorithm has
done ``enough'' exploration and consistently finds the global optimum.  Adding
additional particles to the swarm is akin to increasing its capacity for
exploration.  We have seen that for a 20-dimensional Griewank function, 30
particles is not ``enough'' exploration, but 100 is.  For these functions, one
should use processors to increase the swarm size until enough exploration has
been reached, then use additional processors to increase the number of
iterations performed.

There are still other functions for which it seems there is never enough
exploration, such as the Rastrigin function.  It has been shown that up to 4000
particles there is no point at which ``enough'' exploration has been
done~\cite{mcnabb-cec09}.  For those functions the correct use of processors
cannot be easily prescribed and depends largely on the desired outcome and how
many processors are available.  It is likely that the best thing to do with
those functions is to use all processors to add particles to the swarm and do
no speculative evaluation.

\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future}

This work represents the first attempt of which we are aware at using
additional processors in parallel with PSO to do something other than either
add particles to the swarm or parallelize the evaluation of the objective
function.  We anticipate that many future advancements can be made.  For
example, our technique required speculatively evaluating every possible next
position of each particle.  The number of speculative evaluations could
potentially be greatly reduced by using statistics for which branch of motion
particles most often follow.  Only the subset of the most probable next
locations would then be evaluated.  Using an asynchronous PSO variant may also
be helpful in this case, allowing particles to be at different iterations in
case the correct branch was not guessed and needs to be evaluated separately.

Another possible advancement would be to reduce communication costs by dropping
some of the inter-processor messages in distributed frameworks.  The PSO
algorithm would have to be adapted to work with less information, perhaps not
requiring that each processor have completely accurate information about what
neighboring particles are doing.

Still another possibility is to view the set of possible evaluations as an
infinite tree.  Each level in the tree is an iteration, and the branches on
each level represent the possible next positions of the particle.  One need not
simply evaluate all of one level for each particle---perhaps going two or three
iterations ahead on the most likely path would perform better.

We have mentioned that this technique has been previously used to parallelize
simulated annealing.  Any other optimization algorithm that only depends on
current sampling positions when computing the next position to sample can be
parallelized with this technique.  In particular, genetic algorithms produce
future generations by combining individuals from the current generation.  With
a large population size there would be an unwieldy amount of possible future
individuals, but the potential exists to modify the algorithm to use some kind
of speculative evaluation.  A related but quite distinct technique for reducing
computation in evolutionary algorithms was proposed
in~\cite{poli-2006-backward-chaining-evolutionary-algorithms}.

Large parallel clusters are often required to successfully optimize practical
modern problems.  To properly use PSO with such clusters, a balance needs to be
made between using processors to increase the swarm size and using them to
increase the speed of the algorithm, or for perhaps as yet unconsidered
techniques.  This work is a first step in that direction.
